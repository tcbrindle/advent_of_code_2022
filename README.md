# C++20 solutions to Advent of Code 2022 #

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). The code is written in C++20.

The source file(s) for each day are in their own directories. There is no build system or anything like that: just `cd` to a directory and compile using the command line. The solutions have been tested with GCC 12, and may or may not work with other compilers.

Most of the solutions use a functional programming library called [Flux](https://github.com/tcbrindle/libflux).
